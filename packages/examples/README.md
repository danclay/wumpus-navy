This contains an example of a bot using eris-fleet with one service. It uses classes to pass the bot and service classes instead of files. The basics of this example also apply to oceanic-fleet.

This is written in Typescript and the code is under src/.

[See Github for the example](https://github.com/danclay/wumpus-navy/tree/main/packages/examples)
